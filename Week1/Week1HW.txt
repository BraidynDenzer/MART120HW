When looking at the difference between GUI and CLI some majors differences come to eye. First of GUI is far more user friendly than ClI. GUI utilizes More menus and is just generally more appealing than CLI. GUI also feels less intimidating then LCI due to its look. Another difference between GUI and CLI is the ease of use. As stated in one of your videos on this topic you said that LCI looked more intimidating but in turn, was more powerful. This topic can also be tied in with functionality as well as ease of use. Gui is less functional but more user friendly while CLI is less user friendly and has more functionality. Another thing relating to functionality is the speed you can use these programs. While using GUI it typically takes users longer to code than CLI users due to the navigation through the menus. Those are my main differences between GUI and CLI.
